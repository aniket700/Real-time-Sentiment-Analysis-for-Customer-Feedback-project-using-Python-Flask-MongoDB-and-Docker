# Real-time-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Customer-Feedback-project-using-Python-Flask-MongoDB-and-Docker
This project is a Flask-based RESTful API that performs real-time sentiment analysis on customer feedback. It classifies text as positive, neutral, or negative using NLTK's Vader Sentiment Analyzer. The results are then stored in MongoDB for further analysis.
